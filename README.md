## Setup Instructions

* Prerequisites
    Node.js
    npm 

# Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/GSMunde/Expert_Buddy.git
    cd assignment-app

2. Install Dependencies:
    npm install

3. Start the Development Server:

4. Access the Application: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Tech Stack

# Frontend:
   * React.js: For building dynamic UI components.
   * React Router: For navigation and routing.
   * Context API: For state management.
   * Tailwind CSS: For responsive styling.
   * React Hook Form: For form handling and validation.

# Data:
   * Mock JSON data stored in src/Context/mockUsers.js.

## How the Application Works

1. Authentication:
   * The login system validates credentials against the mockData.json file and simulates authentication using state variables.
    
2. Event Management:
    * Events are stored in the JSON file and filtered on the frontend without requiring a backend.

3. Teaching Resources:
    * Resources are dynamically loaded and categorized using the data from the JSON file.

## Core Features

1. Authentication & User Management
   * User registration and login using mock data.
   * Role-based access (Admin, Tutor, Student).
   * Profile management with editable fields.

2. Navbar
   * Navigation menu includes links to Home, Events, Profile, and Resources.

3. Homepage Feed
   * Rich-text announcements with comments and reactions.
   * Pagination or infinite scroll for seamless browsing.

4. Events System
   * Filterable event listing.
   * RSVP functionality and detailed event view.

5. Teaching Resources
   * Categorized resources with preview and bookmarking options.
   * Searchable and filterable resource database.

6. Community Features
   * Real-time chat simulated with mock data.
   * Q&A section with voting and categorization.

7. Settings & Documentation
   * Profile customization and privacy toggles.
   * Onboarding guide with FAQs and tutorials.

## Future Improvements

1. Backend Integration:
 * Replace mock data with real backend APIs for dynamic updates.
 
2. Enhanced Features:
 * Add push notifications for events and messages.
 * Enable private messaging for community members.

3. Mobile App:
 * Develop a mobile-friendly version using React Native.

4. Improved Performance:
 * Implement lazy loading for components and assets.
